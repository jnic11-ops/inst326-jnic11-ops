Week 1
- Didn't use AI very much
- While coding in the google colab it does make AI suggestions but I continued with my work trying to rely on those as much as possible
- The AI suggestions did come in handy when there were terms I was forgetful about or not confident in their use

Week 2
- AI came in handy this week for researching terms that I was less familiar with or forgot such as != or other ones that I forgot when the right time to use them was
-It also helped for my problem solving, an example chat would be "why is this code not returning correctly?" which the response was that I had mispelt a variable and didn't realize
- AI also helped when I was stuck on a problem and didn't know the next step to take in figuring it out

Week 3
- This week I relied on AI more than the previous weeks
- I struggled with this weeks assignment and understanding it so AI helped me break it down and understand what I was doing and when to use it
- It helped with problem solving when something I was doing wasn't working as well

Week 4
- Didn't rely on AI too heavily this week, readings were very helpful in understanding the concepts
- AI was very helpful in my troubleshooting and understanding what i was doing wrong
- AI was also useful in researching what certain things did, especially when they were recommended and I didn't know what it was or what it did
- The recommendations did come in handy when solving the problems and helping get started

Week 5
- AI was very useful for my studying this week, and explaining concepts such as encapsulation to me.
- As always it was also helpful with problem-solving/troubleshooting when code wouldn't work. (helpful for finding mispells)
- Used AI to help generate and start idea functions for Project 01.
- AI recommendations also helped when I was in a stuck spot and unsure what to do next.
